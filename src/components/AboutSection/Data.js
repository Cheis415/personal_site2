  development thanks to the guidance and training of Code Tenderloin and the 
  esteemed Rithm School. After years of working my way from Laborer to Lead 
  Supervisor in the construction field, I wanted to finally explore my 
  life-long passion for tech and apply it to a new career. While I am 
  not a typical software engineering applicant, I bring a unique perspective 
  and skill-set to the projects that I work on.
