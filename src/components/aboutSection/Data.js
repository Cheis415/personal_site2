  description: `I come from a non technical background. I started my journey in software development at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, thanks to the guidance and training of Code Tenderloin and the esteemed Rithm School, hoping to finally explore my life-long passion for tech and apply it to a new career. While I am not a typical software engineering applicant, I bring a unique perspective and skill-set to the projects that I work on. Before making the dive into software engineering, I worked in the field of construction. I started out as a laborer and worked my way up to lead supervisor.

  description2: `Today, I volunteer as a sobriety coach and mentor, channeling my experiences with childhood trauma and addiction to serve those going through similar hardships today. With my unique life experience and decade of hard work in the construction business, I bring years of time-sensitive problem solving and collaboration skills (and a healthy sense of humor) to coding. See what Iâ€™ve been working on!`,
